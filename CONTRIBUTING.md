### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: You will have to add the required code to enhance the features.
- **qa-needed**: QA will check for the Quality of the product and suggest the features.
- **documentation-needed**: Strong detailed docuemntation will be needed for the product
- **bug-high-priority**: Mark it with high priority, when you want that to be fixed urgently.
- **bug-low-priority**: Mark it with low priority, which are less important and will be solved later on fixing the High priority bugs.
- **help-wanted**: Help content should be added to let user know, how and where to reach out for any help using the product.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
